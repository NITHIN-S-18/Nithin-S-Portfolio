## Live demo

- Live site (GitHub Pages - assumed): https://nithin-s-18.github.io/Nithin-S-Portfolio/
- Repository: https://github.com/NITHIN-S-18/Nithin-S-Portfolio

Note: I assumed GitHub Pages is used at the standard URL above. If your Pages site is on a custom domain or not enabled, open the project locally (see below).

## Features

- Immersive 3D scenes and animated models using Three.js
- Responsive design across mobile, tablet and desktop
- Interactive project showcase with links and descriptions
- Fast development and optimized bundling with Vite

## Tech stack

- React
- Three.js
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Run locally

Windows (cmd.exe) ‚Äî from repo root:

```cmd
cd /d v:\portfolilo\3d-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Production build and preview:

```cmd
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

This project can be deployed to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host that supports SPA routing. If you want GitHub Pages:

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Push the `dist`/build output to your `gh-pages` branch or use GitHub Actions / Vercel to deploy automatically.

## Contributing

- Use feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/describe-change`
- Commit concise messages and push the branch: `git push -u origin feature/describe-change`
- Open a Pull Request on GitHub to merge into `main`.

## License & Contact

- Repo: https://github.com/NITHIN-S-18/Nithin-S-Portfolio
- If you'd like me to add a license file or a contact link, tell me which email or profile to include and I will add it.

---

If you want, I can also:
- Add a screenshot or animated GIF to the README
- Enable a GitHub Pages deployment workflow (create a `gh-pages` deploy script or GitHub Action)

(Assumption: GitHub Pages URL above is the standard pages URL; update it if you use a custom domain.)
